# Reading test - Web assembly
 
Read the following text about web assembly from MSDN and answer the questions below it:
```
WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers and provides new features and major gains in performance.

It is not primarily intended to be written by hand, rather it is designed to be an effective compilation target for source languages like C, C++, Rust, etc.

This has huge implications for the web platform â€” it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed,
with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so.

What's more, you don't even have to know how to create WebAssembly code to take advantage of it.

WebAssembly modules can be imported into a web (or Node.js) app, exposing WebAssembly functions for use via JavaScript.

JavaScript frameworks could make use of WebAssembly to confer massive performance advantages and new features while still making functionality easily available to web developers.
